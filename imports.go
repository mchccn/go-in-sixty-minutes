/*
This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.

You can also write multiple import statements, like:

import "fmt"
import "math"

But it is good style to use the factored import statement.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Now you have %g problems.\n", math.Sqrt(7))
